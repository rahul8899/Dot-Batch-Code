            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ (listen); 15
            October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and
            statesman who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007.
            He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and
            aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and
            science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development
            Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and
            was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military
            missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile
            Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and
            launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal
            organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II
            nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by
            India in 1974
